function [r_th,z_th,index] = threshold(r,z,th)
% THRESHOLD gets the correlations and Fisher Z-transformed matrices and 
% applies the threshold on them by considering the significacy and 
% consistency of the correlations.
%
% [R_TH,Z_TH,INDEX] = THRESHOLD(R,Z,TH) gets N-by-M correlation and Fisher 
% Z-transformed matrices R and Z and applies the threshold TH on 
% them. Finally, the thresholded correlation and FisherZ-transformed 
% matrices R_TH and Z_TH (N-by-M) are generated and the indices of 
% insignificant arrays INDEX (N-by-N) are given as output.
